# Piezo Pickup Preamplifier
This is a simple design for a high impedance preamplifier. It is intended for
piezo pickups, and in particular for piezo bridge pickups for (nylon-stringed)
guitars.

It is a pretty classic opamp circuit, with the main feature being that it is
quite compact (and notably: narrow). The idea is to fit this preamplifier into
a slot immediately below the pickup.

The design is in KiCad. A PDF with the schematic, and the Gerber files for the
PCB are also provided.
